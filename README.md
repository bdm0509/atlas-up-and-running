Code samples and support for the book _PyTorch: Up and Running_ published by O'Reilly Media

## Using Code Examples

The book that generated these code samples is here to help you get your job done. In general, you may use the examples in this repository in your programs and documentation. You do not need to contact O'Reilly or me for permission unless you're reproducing a significant portion of the code. For example, writing a program that uses several chunks of code from this repo and the book does not require permission. Selling or distributing a CD-ROM of examples from O'Reilly books does require permission. (Are people really still using CD-ROMs?) Answering a question by citing example code does not require permission. Incorporating a significant amount of example code into your product's documentation does require permission.

We appreciate, but do not require, attribution. An attribution usually includes the title, author, publisher, and ISBN. For example: “PyTorch: Up and Running by Brett McLaughlin (O'Reilly). Copyright 2018 Brett McLaughlin, XXX.”

If you feel your use of code examples falls outside fair use or the permission given above, feel free to [contact O'Reilly](permissions@oreilly.com).
